# Task 8: VPN Setup and Privacy Testing

## Objective:
To set up and test a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to understand how it protects user privacy and secures internet communication.

---

##  Tools Used:
- **VPN Client:** ProtonVPN (Free)
- **Website for IP Verification:** https://whatismyipaddress.com
- **Browser:** Google Chrome

---

## Steps Performed:

1. Created a free account on [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com).
2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client on Windows.
3. Logged in using ProtonVPN credentials.
4. Connected to a **Netherlands-based server** using the free tier.
5. Verified the new VPN-assigned IP using [whatismyipaddress.com].
6. Disconnected and compared the IP address to my original (real) IP.
7. Observed and documented the benefits of encryption and location masking.

## IP Verification

### ðŸ”¹ Original IP (Before VPN):
- **Location:** India  
- **IP Address:** *(Not shown for privacy)*  
- **ISP:** Local Indian ISP  
- **Detected Country:** India

### ðŸ”¹ VPN IP (After Connection to ProtonVPN):
- **New IP Address:** 185.180.222.125  
- **Hostname:** 185-180-222-125.hosted-by-worldstream.net  
- **ISP:** WorldStream B.V.  
- **Service:** VPN Server  
- **Location:** Naaldwijk, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands  
- **Latitude/Longitude:** 51.9941Â° N, 4.2099Â° E  

âž¡ **Result:** The VPN successfully masked my real IP and assigned a new IP from the Netherlands, confirming location spoofing and encryption of traffic.

---

## What VPN Does:

- Encrypts internet traffic using protocols like **WireGuard** or **OpenVPN**.
- Hides real IP address and assigns a temporary one from the VPN server.
- Secures data transmission over public Wi-Fi.
- Prevents ISP, trackers, or attackers from monitoring browsing activity.

---

## Benefits of Using a VPN:

- Hides your identity and real location.
- Protects sensitive data from hackers and trackers.
- Helps access restricted content (e.g., region-locked sites).
- Enhances privacy during remote work or public internet usage.

---

##  Limitations of VPNs:

- Free plans may have slower speeds or limited servers.
- VPN is not a full anonymity tool (e.g., browser fingerprinting still possible).
- Some websites or apps may block VPN access.

---

## Conclusion:

Setting up and using a VPN helped me understand how it secures internet traffic and protects privacy by masking the real IP. The change from my original Indian IP to a Netherlands-based IP confirmed that VPNs are effective in anonymizing user identity online. This hands-on task improved my awareness of internet privacy and secure browsing practices.
